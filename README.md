Dragon Air Design

Background
The land of Berk faces a terrible winter, the likes of which has never been seen. We haven’t been able to secure enough food on our own to ensure our survival, so we must rely on our greatest commodity in the shadow of the storm, our dragons. They are our friends and companions, and by creating Dragon Air, we can raise enough to fill our halls and our bellies for the coming winter. We provide the fastest transit, the most security, and the trip of a lifetime for anyone brave enough to take to the skies on the back of a dragon.

Users
Back End
Our team of Dragon Trainers are the finest (and only) on Midguard. The have trained the dragons to fly fast and easy. Only the most intelligent dragons are selected for this task, and only the brightest riders will accompany you on your journey to your destination.
Front end
Front end users can reserve any of our dragons available for a ride, and choose any of our riders to accompany them on their journey. 
We take in transportation and security requests from merchants, families, and even villages. We have a dragon for all occasions. 
This endeavor will start off with 6 dragons, 5 riders, and 3 destinations.

Use Cases
Security – Sailing near the dreaded Outcast Isles? Book a security detail to and from the Island, to ensure the safety of you and your goods.
Transit – Have family up north? Take a dragon to shave off a few weeks of sailing on the high seas, and impress your family by showing up on a flying fire-breathing reptile.

Functional Requirements
Riders need a valid email address, and must be able to read and write. The dragon does all navigation, so you won’t need a map

Non functional requirements
Dragons cannot fly overburdened, the dragons will have a weight limit listed on their page, you must keep track of what you are carrying, and request a dragon that satisfies your needs.

Design Specs
Content needs – We will need to know the number of people travelling, the expected weight of your group, and if you have been cursed by any of the gods (for liability reasons).
Media needs – If you look to your left or right in flight, you will usually see a beautiful sun rising above or sinking below the clouds, or a fantastic night sky (our dragons fly above the clouds).
External links – Contact your local weather witch for forecasts.
